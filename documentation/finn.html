<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
<p>Ambitious college student that has worked diligently and earned mostly everything he has by his own volition. When
    not in class or cramming to finish an assignment, is known to undertake various jobs. Loves to earn money. Is
    currently into saving, investing in cryptocurrencies, and minting NFTs. Currently, does work on food delivery
    applications. Speeds often and has sometimes had to replace tires or get body work due to damages.</p>
<h3>Frustrations and Needs:</h3>
<p>Finn loves investing his money and hates when having to make large or unexpected payments. Twice this school year,
    he has had to take his car in for repairs due to damages from potholes. Finn needs a system for identifying and
    helping to avoid potholes, being able to mark potholes for future reference, and reporting potholes in hopes that
    they are filled.</p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>Finn is in his vehicle often and has had his fair-share of run-ins with potholes. Finn wants to be able to
    identify potholes ahead of time, so he can either avoid the route, or be weary and navigate the route cautiously.
    Finn also wants to be able to mark potholes for other motorists to help them avoid damages. Lastly, Finn heard
    that the city monitors this application and uses it to set priorities for filling potholes. Finn wants to use the
    application to post pictures of extremely severe potholes, and get them filled.</p>
